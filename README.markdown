Proxy tools
===========

This is a collection of scripts to work with proxies in Ruby. All are pre-alpha, that is, written for my personal use. 

I'm not sure where this will go from here.

For all I know, proxytester.rb takes a newline-separated list of proxies (<address>:<port>) and checks all of them for availability and if they are
completely private, e.g. do not pass your IP to the requested server in any form.

I'm using a page hosted on my server to check that; it simply returns a signature, the perceived remote IP and any request headers. Simple and 
reproducible.
